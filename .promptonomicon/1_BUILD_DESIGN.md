# Design Document Guide

Creates design documents for Phases 1 (Understand) and 2 (Design) of the development process.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE THIS TEMPLATE:
- Add your specific design sections
- Include your architecture patterns
- Define your requirements format
- Add your success criteria style

# Design: [Feature Name]

## Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: [Clear, descriptive name]
**Date**: [Use `date +%Y%m%d`]
**Author**: [Name]
**Status**: Draft

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: what this does and why it's needed]

### Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve?]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Another measurable outcome]

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- [What the system must do]
- [Specific behaviors required]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [expectations]
- Security: [requirements]
- Usability: [standards]

### Constraints
- [Technical/business/time constraints]

## Context Investigation

**First**: Consult the Documentation Index (`.promptonomicon/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`) to identify relevant documentation to review.

### Repository Analysis
- Architecture patterns: [what exists]
- Similar features: [examples]
- Integration points: [where this fits]

**Reference Documentation**:
- Review architecture docs (if applicable): See `.promptonomicon/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- Review similar feature docs: See `ai-docs/features/` and previous design docs in `ai-docs/ai-design/`
- Review API docs (if using APIs): See `.promptonomicon/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- Review implementation docs: See `ai-docs/ai-implementation/` for lessons learned

### Technical Stack
- [Languages, frameworks, tools in use]

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach
[Overall strategy in 1-2 paragraphs]

### Architecture Principles to Apply

**SOLID Principles**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Design for extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived components can replace base components
- **Interface Segregation**: Create focused, specific interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Separate presentation, business logic, and data access
- Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- Changes in one layer shouldn't cascade to others

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
- Identify common patterns and abstractions
- Extract shared logic into reusable components
- Avoid duplicating business rules or validation logic

**KISS (Keep It Simple)**:
- Choose the simplest solution that solves the problem
- Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**:
- Build only what's needed now
- Don't add features "just in case"
- Avoid premature abstraction

### Component Design
- **[Component Name]**
  - Purpose: [what it does - single, clear purpose]
  - Responsibilities: [what it owns - list specific responsibilities]
  - Interfaces: [how it connects - input/output contracts]
  - Dependencies: [what it depends on - use abstractions where possible]
  - State: [what state it manages, if any]

**Component Design Principles**:
- Each component should have a single, clear responsibility
- Components should be loosely coupled (minimal dependencies)
- Components should be highly cohesive (related functionality together)
- Interfaces should be minimal and focused
- Dependencies should flow in one direction (dependency inversion)

### Data Flow
[How data moves through the system]

**Data Flow Principles**:
- Data flows unidirectionally when possible
- State management is explicit and predictable
- Data transformations are clear and testable
- Avoid global mutable state
- Use immutable data structures when appropriate

### Error Handling
[Fail-hard approach - no silent failures]

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Validate inputs at system boundaries
- Fail immediately with clear error messages
- No silent failures or fallback values
- Errors propagate to appropriate handlers
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- User-facing errors should be user-friendly
- Internal errors should be logged with technical details

## Implementation Considerations

### Dependencies
- [Package]: [version] - [why needed]

### Testing Strategy

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
- Write tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Use mocks/stubs for external dependencies

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests: Test individual components in isolation
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- System tests: Test end-to-end workflows
- Edge cases: Boundary conditions, invalid inputs, error states
- Test coverage target: >90%

**What to Test**:
- Happy path: Expected behavior with valid inputs
- Error paths: Invalid inputs, missing data, error conditions
- Edge cases: Empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions
- Integration: Component interactions, data flow
- Regression: Previously fixed bugs

## Alternatives Considered

### [Alternative Name]
- Approach: [brief description]
- Pros: [benefits]
- Cons: [drawbacks]
- Why not chosen: [reasoning]

## Open Questions
- [ ] [Questions needing answers]

**Note**: After completing Phase 2, proceed to Phase 2.5 to resolve any open questions. **You MUST ask the user for feedback on each open question - do NOT make decisions on your own. Wait for the user's response before proceeding to Phase 3 (Plan).**

## Resolved Questions
*(Move questions here after Phase 2.5)*

- [Question]: [Answer/Decision from developer]
- [Question]: [Answer/Decision from developer]

## Decisions Needed
- [Decision]: [options and recommendation]
```

## Output
Save as: `[your-docs-dir]/design/[date]_design_[feature_name].md`

## Next Step
1. If the design document contains "Open Questions", proceed to Phase 2.5 to resolve them with the developer
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask the user for feedback on each open question
   - **DO NOT** make decisions on how to proceed - wait for the user's input
   - **DO NOT** proceed to Phase 3 until the user confirms all questions are resolved
2. Once all questions are resolved (or if there are no open questions), proceed to Phase 3 using 3_BUILD_PLAN.md
